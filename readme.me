#	st - simple terminal
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


#	Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


#	Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).
```
X11INC = /usr/include/X11
X11LIB = /usr/lib/X11
```
Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):
```
make clean install
```

#	Running st
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:
```
tic -sx st.info
```
See the man page for additional details.
